# Obsidian support in Neovim

Has (rudimentary) support for Obsidian's style of file system

## TODO list

- [ ] Make completion trigger on entering "[["
- [ ] When inserting notes, account for the case when multiple notes have the same name (and so you need to include a prefix to differentiate them)
- [ ] Make a `setup` function to customise keybindings

## Dependencies

- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
